15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?
ans:- To install Python on Windows and set the path variables, follow these steps:

1. **Download Python:**

   Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the latest stable version of Python for Windows. You can choose between the 32-bit and 64-bit versions, depending on your system.

2. **Run the Installer:**

   Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on the downloaded executable file (e.g., `python-3.x.x.exe`) to run the Python installer.

3. **Customize Installation (Optional):**

   During the installation process, you will see an options screen. You can customize the installation by clicking on the "Customize installation" button. Here you can select additional features or change the installation directory, but for most users, the default settings are sufficient.

4. **Add Python to PATH (Important):**

   On the same options screen, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH." This step is crucial as it allows you to run Python from the command prompt without specifying the full path to the Python executable.

   

5. **Install Python:**

   Click the "Install Now" button to start the installation process. Python will be installed with the selected settings.

6. **Verify Installation:**

   To verify that Python is installed correctly, open the Windows Command Prompt by searching for "cmd" or "Command Prompt" in the Windows search bar. Then, type the following command and press Enter:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   This command should display the Python version you installed.

7. **Verify PATH Variable:**

   To ensure that Python is accessible from any command prompt, you can type the following command to run the Python interpreter:

   ```
   python
   ```

   This should start the Python interpreter, and you can now enter Python commands interactively. To exit the Python interpreter, you can type `exit()` or press `Ctrl+Z` followed by `Enter`.

That's it! we 've successfully installed Python on Windows and set up the necessary path variables. You can now start writing and running Python scripts on your Windows machine.
